**Project baby**

Project baby is an application addressed to young parents - it allows you to record every activity of the child during the day in order to create a pattern, routine, so important in the first months of a child's life. 

Baby's day is, contrary to appearances, a lot of activity - from naps, to meals, lots of games that develop the child's mind. Attempting to remember them on your own and repeating them every day may end in a fiasco, due to the amount of activity and also due to the enormity of other activities that young parents have during the day. Thanks to the application that I created, we will not forget about all activities, games and we will be able to control the time of performing a given activity.

For me personally, such an application is the basis of the day - thanks to the ability to save the start and end time of e.g. breastfeeding the baby on the phone, I did not have to remember whether the previous feeding was too long or too short, and which breast I used then. I also don't have to carry a piece of paper and a pen with me - a phone is enough.

We add each activity by specifying the start and end time. In addition, the activity can be edited and deleted. Activities are saved in MySql database (dev environment) and in H2 database (tests). My project is a SpringBoot app, I'm using Gradle, Lombok, Mapstruct, strategy design pattern.

The application is still ongoing.
